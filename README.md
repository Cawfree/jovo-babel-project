# jovo-babel-project
An example project using Jovo Framework alongside JavaScript ES6.

## About
This is a simple _Hello, World!_ directory that will help you get you up and running with a maintainable [`jovo-framework`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jovo-framework) project as fast as possible.

This project inludes `ngrok` for port tunnelling. To initialize:
  - execute `./node_modules/ngrok/bin/ngrok http 3000`
